# Implementation Selection: RawNet2 for Audio Deepfake Detection

After analyzing the three promising approaches identified in Part 1, I've selected **End-to-End Anti-Spoofing with RawNet2** for implementation. This document outlines the rationale for this selection and the implementation plan.

## Rationale for Selecting RawNet2

1. **End-to-end architecture**: RawNet2 works directly on raw waveforms without requiring handcrafted feature extraction, which simplifies the implementation pipeline and potentially captures subtle artifacts missed by traditional feature extraction methods.

2. **Strong performance metrics**: With an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.12% (ranked #5) and tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) of 0.033 (ranked #3), RawNet2 demonstrates excellent effectiveness in detecting audio deepfakes.

3. **Available implementation**: The original authors have provided a complete implementation on GitHub (https://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing), making it feasible to adapt and fine-tune for our purposes.

4. **Potential for real-time applications**: While not the most lightweight model, RawNet2's architecture can be optimized for near real-time inference with appropriate hardware.

5. **Published in a reputable venue**: The paper was published at ICASSP '21, indicating peer review and scientific rigor.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the existing implementation from https://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing

2. **Dataset selection**: Use the ASVspoof 5 dataset as suggested in the assignment, which is appropriate for this model as it was designed for logical access spoofing detection.

3. **Environment setup**: Create a Python environment with the required dependencies as specified in the repository's requirements.txt.

4. **Convert to Jupyter notebook format**: Restructure the implementation into a Jupyter notebook for better documentation and visualization of the training process.

5. **Fine-tuning**: Perform light re-training/fine-tuning on the selected dataset, focusing on:
   - Adapting the model to the specific characteristics of the ASVspoof 5 dataset
   - Potentially reducing model complexity for faster inference
   - Experimenting with different hyperparameters

6. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using standard metrics (EER, t-DCF) and analyze its effectiveness in detecting various types of audio deepfakes.

7. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the implementation process, challenges encountered, and results obtained.

## Technical Comparison with Other Approaches

### Compared to Voice Spoofing Countermeasure for Logical Access Attacks

- **Feature extraction**: RawNet2 works directly on raw waveforms, while the Voice Spoofing Countermeasure uses ELTP-LFCC features, which require more preprocessing.
- **Network architecture**: RawNet2 uses a specialized architecture with sinc filters, whereas the Voice Spoofing Countermeasure employs a DBiLSTM network.
- **Computational efficiency**: The Voice Spoofing Countermeasure might be more efficient due to its feature-based approach, but RawNet2 potentially captures more subtle artifacts.

### Compared to Overlapped Frequency-Distributed Network

- **Feature diversity**: The Overlapped Frequency-Distributed Network uses multiple complementary features (Mel-Spectrogram and CQT), while RawNet2 learns features directly from raw audio.
- **Complexity**: The Overlapped Frequency-Distributed Network is more complex with multiple feature extraction pipelines, whereas RawNet2 has a more streamlined architecture.
- **Frequency awareness**: The Overlapped Frequency-Distributed Network explicitly targets frequency-domain artifacts, while RawNet2 learns relevant patterns from the data without explicit frequency-domain modeling.

## Expected Challenges

1. **Dataset preprocessing**: Ensuring the ASVspoof 5 dataset is properly formatted for the RawNet2 model.
2. **Computational requirements**: Training RawNet2 might require significant computational resources.
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Finding the optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning on the new dataset.
4. **Generalization**: Ensuring the model generalizes well to different types of audio deepfakes beyond those in the training data.
